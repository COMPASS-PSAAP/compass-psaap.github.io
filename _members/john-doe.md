I am an associate professor in the department of Computer Science at the University of New Mexico and director of the Data Science Laboratory . My research interests span the intersection of Machine Learning, High Performance Computing, Big Data, and their applications to interdisciplinary problems.

The goal of my research program is to solve computationally intensive and data intensive problems in science, health, and education, especially in scenarios where resources and trained professionals are scarce. I believe that a computer is only as good as the difference it can make in the world, and I strive to achieve this level of impact with my work.

I obtained a PhD in computer science from University of Delaware where I worked with Dr. Michela Taufer on integrating application-aware self-management to global distributed computing environments with the final goal of making them accessible to a wider scientific community. I also got a M.S in computer science from INAOE, Puebla with Dr Olac Fuentes, and a B.S in informatics from the Universidad de Guadalajara, Jalisco.

I'm originally from Guadalajara, a beautiful city in the western-pacific side of Mexico. My name, Trilce, (pronounced in english like tree-il-sËˆe)) is a neologism invented by peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo.
